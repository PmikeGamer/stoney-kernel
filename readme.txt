This fork is for pre-built kernels since I was mad I couldn't just download the kernel.
People will yell at you and tell you to not download pre-built kernels, and to each their own. Believe what you want but I didn't do anything to the kernel, I just built it.

usage: ./build.sh <distro>
possible distros are: alpine, none
if no distro is specified, all will be packaged
